My role in the IceCrew team is being the artist. So, I worked on many different aspects to fulfill duties as the artist. What I spent the most time on, was taking all the different sprites from Link, the enemies, the npc's and also from the various animations that the game has right now. Apart from taking sprites I had to create some of them. My teammates remark that the dodging roll I created for Link is the best sprites I created for the game. I enjoyed creating them and I think they fit really well right now in our game.

Some of the other sprites I created where the different doors that our dungeons needed, so here you can see them:
